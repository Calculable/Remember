// Hmmm... Maybe choosing a canvas to draw the timeline was not my best idea. See documentation from apple: "Use a canvas to improve performance for a drawing that doesnâ€™t primarily involve text or require interactive elements." Also, canvas is not accessible for voice over users. (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/canvas)
